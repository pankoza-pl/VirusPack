 - Handling -

Press F1 when the program is running. A help window will appear and explain all options.
Clicking on a character opens a menu offering to close the program or to show the help.



 - System requirements -

Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP 
The software has been tested on Win98 and Win2000. But theoretically it should also run on the other Windows versions. 

Although the software worked on a 133 MHz CPU I would recommend at least 300 MHz.

This program requires the Microsoft Visual Basic 6 runtime library msvbvm60.dll to be installed in the system folder (most likely "C:\windows\system\"). You most probably already have it. If not, the program will return an error. 
You can download it at

or at

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/

and unzip it into your system folder.
